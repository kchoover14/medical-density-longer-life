## Access to Health Care Workers Increases Life Expectancy

WHO Global Health Observatory data on the density of dentists, medical doctors, and nurses/midwives across 179 countries (2000--2015) were merged with life expectancy data and analyzed using linear regression. The analysis finds that dentist density has a disproportionately large impact on life expectancy -- each additional dentist per 10,000 people adds nearly one full year of life -- and that 43 countries in Africa, Asia, and Oceania have health worker density too low to produce a detectable effect, representing the primary targets for international assistance investment.
